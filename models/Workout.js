// totalDistance: "Total Distance Covered"

//Add New Workout
//Complete Workout - probably need a true/false entry for completed.
//On complete, calculate totalFields above and add to completed record. Implies we should create those as fields in a workout record.
//Stats then pulls from last 7 workouts and aggregates the total. But how does that get rendered? 

//Process:
//Build model for workout collection (what is the db called dburl?)
//Seed db with seed file
//Add a get/all route to pull back data from workouts
